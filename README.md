### Philosophy

- Nothing is hidden from you, so you have the freedom to make the necessary adjustments to fit your needs and preferences.
- Dependencies are updated every month
- Easy to customize
- Minimal code
- SEO-friendly
- 🚀 Production-ready

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
npm install
```

For your information, all dependencies are updated every month.

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Set up authentication

### Translation (i18n) setup

For translation, the project uses `next-intl` combined with [Crowdin](https://l.crowdin.com/next-js). As a developer, you only need to take care of the English (or another default language) version. Other languages are automatically generated and handled by Crowdin. You can use Crowdin to collaborate with your translation team or translate the messages yourself with the help of machine translation.

To set up translation (i18n), create an account at [Crowdin.com](https://l.crowdin.com/next-js) and create a new project. In the newly created project, you will able to find the project ID. You'll also require to create a new Personal Access Tokens by going to Account Settings > API. Then, in your GitHub Actions, you need to define the following environment variables `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`.

After defining the environment variables in your GitHub Actions, your localization files will be synchronized with Crowdin everytime you push a new commit to the `main` branch.

### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
npm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Testing

All unit tests are located with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with:

```shell
npm run test
```

### Enable Edge runtime (optional)

The App Router folder is compatible with the Edge runtime. You can enable it by adding the following lines `src/app/layouts.tsx`:

```tsx
export const runtime = 'edge';
```

### Deploy to production

You can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. For testing the generated build, you can run:

```shell
$ npm run start
```

The command starts a local server with the production build. Then, you can now open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see the project.


### Useful commands

#### Bundle Analyzer

The app comes with a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
npm run build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Vitest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
